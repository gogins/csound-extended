@book{citeulike:106131,
	abstract = {{Physics and computer science genius Stephen Wolfram, whose Mathematica computer language launched a multimillion-dollar company, now sets his sights on a more daunting goal: understanding the universe. Wolfram lets the world see his work in <I>A New Kind of Science</I>, a gorgeous, 1,280-page tome more than a decade in the making. With patience, insight, and self-confidence to spare, Wolfram outlines a fundamental new way of modeling complex systems.<p>  On the frontier of complexity science since he was a boy, Wolfram is a  champion of cellular automata--256 "programs" governed by simple  nonmathematical rules. He points out that even the most complex  equations fail to accurately model biological systems, but the simplest  cellular automata can produce results straight out of nature--tree  branches, stream eddies, and leopard spots, for instance. The graphics  in <I>A New Kind of Science</I> show striking resemblance to the  patterns we see in nature every day.<p>  Wolfram wrote the book in a distinct style meant to make it easy to read,   even for nontechies; a basic familiarity with logic is helpful but  not essential. Readers will find themselves swept away by the elegant  simplicity of Wolfram's ideas and the accidental artistry of the  cellular automaton models. Whether or not Wolfram's revolution  ultimately gives us the keys to the universe, his new science is  absolutely awe-inspiring. <I>--Therese Littleton</I>} {This long-awaited work from one of the world's most respected scientists presents a series of dramatic discoveries never before made public. Starting from a collection of simple computer experiments---illustrated in the book by striking computer graphics---Wolfram shows how their unexpected results force a whole new way of looking at the operation of our universe.  <P>Wolfram uses his approach to tackle a remarkable array of fundamental problems in science: from the origin of the Second Law of thermodynamics, to the development of complexity in biology, the computational limitations of mathematics, the possibility of a truly fundamental theory of physics, and the interplay between free will and determinism.  <P>Written with exceptional clarity, and illustrated by more than a thousand original pictures, this seminal book allows scientists and non-scientists alike to participate in what promises to be a major intellectual revolution.}},

All declarations in the Standard C++ library are in the \url{std} namespace, and all of the C runtime header files such as \url{stdio.h} have also been brought into the \url{std} namespace, following the pattern of using the \verb|#include <cstdio>| header in place of \verb|#include <stdio.h>|.}

@MISC{stdvector,
note = {The standard C++ library is a \emph{template} library. The collections, algorithms, and streams declared in the library use templates so that they can easily be specialized for any C++ type. For example, \verb|template<typename T> &std::vector<T>::operator[size _t i]| returns a reference to \verb|float| for \verb|std::vector<float>|, and it returns a reference to \verb|std::string| for \verb|std::vector<std::string>|. Furthermore, the standard library carefully separates data from algorithms. Algorithms such as \verb|std::find| are written to work using \emph{iterators} that can be either pointers to elementary types, such as \verb|float *I = &myArray[0]|, or standard library iterators such as \verb|std::vector<float>::iterator it = myVector.begin()|. The meaning of \verb|*i| or \verb|++i| is identical to the meaning of  \verb|*it| or \verb|++it|, so the same template algorithm will work on both types. By separating algorithms from data in this way, the standard library multiplies the number of combinations of data and algorithms that can successfully be used. This is a quite different use of C++ than inheritance.}

Now, place still smaller equilateral triangles in the center of each of the star's 12 sides. Repeat this process infinitely and you have a Koch snowflake, a mind-bending geometric figure with an infinitely large perimeter, yet with a finite area. This is an example of the kind of mathematical puzzles that this book addresses.<p> <I>The Fractal Geometry of Nature</I> is a mathematics text. But buried in the deltas and lambdas and integrals, even a layperson can pick out and appreciate Mandelbrot's point: that somewhere in mathematics, there is an explanation for nature.
